# Physics_Comp_Projects
These are my computational physics projects, which include simulations, Metropolis, Ising model etc.
These were part of the class PHYS 498 Computation in Physics (hence the private repo), a rigourous project based course. The course website is: https://courses.physics.illinois.edu/phys498cmp/fa2017/

Folder names and their project description is as follows
HW 1: It is a coffee mixing, we follow the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.6903.pdf

HW 2: It is simulating a Quantum Computer to run Shor's Algorithm

HW 3: It is creating an Ising Model, performing renormalization and simulated annealing

HW 4: We create hopfield networks and neural networks from scratch

HW 5: Condensed matter work (in progress), Tight binding, compute properties of topological insulators and superconductors
